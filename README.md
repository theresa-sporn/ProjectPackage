## Objective

Create your own toolbox package where you'll store all bits of code you'll want to reuse in the future in order to :

Every time you spend time implementing cool functions, just add it to a file inside your package, add a test function that will test it

## First steps

- Create a project with `wagon-make-package` command
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Start filling in your package with awesome functions you already used

## Examples

You can add to your repo:
- Feature preprocessing functions you used on Time, Distance, Geohash
- Pipeline blocs
- Functions getting data from BigQuery/Storage
- Function querying Weather API
- Function implementing PCA, Feature Selection, Converting categorical feature to numerical
- Function evaluating a regressor and a classifier
- Function implementing your favorite ARIMA forecasts
- Function calling for help from your TAs
- Function Sending Emails
- ...

Enjoy !

**NB: don't forget to add test functions such as**
`len(test_functions) == len(functions)`
